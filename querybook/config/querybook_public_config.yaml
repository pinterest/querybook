            This peer review system helps ensure query quality and data safety.

            Note: Queries that fail after approval will require a new review request.

            Important Guidelines:
            • Choose reviewers familiar with the affected data
            • Include relevant references in query title or justification
            • Document query purpose and impact

            Before Submitting:
            • Run query to verify syntax
            • Validate table names and fields
            • Check query performance

            As a reviewer, you are responsible for validating:

            • Query purpose and necessity
            • Potential data impact
            • Compliance with data policies

            Request clarification if more context is needed.
            Approval cannot be reversed.
