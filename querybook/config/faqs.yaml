faqs:
    - q: 'My queries failed. What do I do?'
      a: |
          <p>
          Check first if the syntax of the query is correct.
          Otherwise please check the line message of the error
          message. There are two common messages:
          </p>
          <ul>
          <li>
              <u className="mr4">
                  <i className="mr8">Error from Query Engine</i>
              </u>
              indicates the error is a run time error from the
              query engine. Please check with the maintainer of
              the said engine.
          </li>
          <li>
              <u className="mr4">
                  <i className="mr8">Error from Querybook worker</i>
              </u>
              is the default error message. It is likely to be
              caused by misconfiguration of Querybook or an internal
              bug. Please check with the maintainer of Querybook to
              find out the root cause of the error.
          </li>
          </ul>
    - q: 'My DataDoc is not saving. What should I do?'
      a: |
          <p>
            When DataDoc is autosaving, there should be a
            spinning loading icon on the top right. First verify
            if it is an issue with websockets, there are two
            possible indicators:
            <ul>
                <li>A red ðŸ”— icon below the saving icon</li>
                <li>
                    Notifications with the message <u><i>Insert cell
                    failed, reason: TypeError: Cannot read
                    property <code>e</code></i></u> shows up
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If any one of these shows up please contact the
                maintainer of Querybook to investigate the cause
                of the failing websocket connection. Otherwise
                if the websocket is working properly, you can
                try to force save a DataDoc by pressing
                cmd/ctrl+s.
            </p>
          </p>
    - q: 'Is there a way to clone a Query Cell and its executions?'
      a: |
          <p>
              You can copy/cut the cell by hovering over the â‹® menu on the right and paste the copied cell. Pasting the cell in a doc will carry over all of its query execution history.
          </p>
    - q: 'How do I use templating? What capabilities does it have?'
      a: |
          <p>
            You can add templating for DataDoc query cells.
            Querybookâ€™s templating uses Jinja2 syntax and
            supports all of its functionalities. You can
            also define any custom templated variable that
            can be shared across different cells by clicking
            the <code><></code> button on the bottom right, they can infer
            other variables and be recursively rendered.
            Some variables are provided automatically. Such
            as:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code>{{today}}</code> which maps to todays date in yyyy-mm-dd
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>{{yesterday}}</code> which maps to yesterdayâ€™s date
                </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
    - q: 'How do I schedule a DataDoc?'
      a: |
          <p>
              You can add a schedule to a DataDoc by clicking on the ðŸ•‘ button on the bottom right. A scheduled DataDoc will run the query cells sequentially from the first query cell to the last query cell and would stop if any of the query cell failed to execute. You can configure the schedule to automatically export the query result with a given exporter.
