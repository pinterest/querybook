Welcome to the first release of Querybook this year üéâ.

Following are the top new features we have added during these past two months:

-   **Advanced Querybook Charting**: Transform data and create charts right from the query results! Added new chart types and customizations.
-   **Collections**: Marie Kondo your workspace by grouping your DataDocs and favorite tables into lists!
-   **Improved Ad Hoc Querying**: Convert a past run into an ad hoc execution with one click! Also draft ad hoc queries are now persistent as you navigate.
-   **Viewer Badge**: Know your consumers! Each doc & table now has a badge to show the total number of views. Clicking it shows its top visitors and trends over time.
-   **Quick Table Reference**: Double click bliss! You can now double click on a table to open it in a new persistent left sidebar when viewing a DataDoc.

#### Creating a list

Create a list by going to the list tab and clicking on the ‚Äú+‚Äù button. List's name is the only required field and does not need to be unique.

Once a list is created, you can add any data docs and tables. Clicking an already added doc/table will remove it from the list.
