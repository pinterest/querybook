## Feature highlights

### AI Assistant

The LLM powered AI assistant can help on

-   Query cell title generation
-   Text to SQL
-   Query error auto fix

Please check the [guide](../user_guide/ai_assistant.md) for more details.

### Vector Table Search

Previously table searching is only keyword based search. Now we introduced [vector store plugin](../integrations/add_ai_assistant.md#vector-store-plugin) and added the support of searching a table by natural language.

### Query Optimization Suggestions

The query editor will provide optimization suggestions for some cases. Here are some predefined one for Presto/Trino

-   distinct count -> approx_distinct
-   like 'a' or like 'b' -> regexp_like(column, 'a|b')
-   union -> union all

You can create you own suggestions by following the example of [PrestoOptimizingValidator](https://github.com/pinterest/querybook/blob/c8949b21c854b367d7bf54f08fbe1a12ad4a47c2/querybook/server/lib/query_analysis/validation/validators/presto_optimizing_validator.py#L177)

Check the [PR](https://github.com/pinterest/querybook/pull/1302) for more details.

### User Group

We introduced the support of user group. Now a user in querybook can be a single user or a user group. A table could be owned by a user group, or a datadoc can be shared to a user group(haven't implemented, PR in progress).

### Data element

A [data element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_element) is an atomic unit of data that has precise meaning or precise semantics, like country, age and etc. We added data element as a new metadata, which can be assigned to a table column to provide more meaningful info for the column.

Note: it can only be synced from metastore.

### Stats logging

Add support of stats logging, like number of users, number of api requests and etc. Please check the [plugin](../integrations/add_stats_logger.md) for more details.
