## Feature highlights

### Query Search
Users can search query executions by statement type, query engine, and runner. Can also put multiple tables to see how they are used together.

### UDF Creator

If your query engine supports UDFs/Stored Procedures, you can use the custom UDF plugin to let users add UDFs easily in the query editor. The UDF editor in Querybook allows users to quickly create UDFs by filling out a form.

### Schedules Page

We added a new page to display all your data docs.

By default, it only shows the scheduled docs, from where you can view and manage the schedules and their run history.

You can also filter or view all the data docs you own.

### Dynamic Result Size
Users can now dynamically configure how many rows of results they want to see on the frontend.

They can also apply this limit for charts, in which case if it is higher than the default limit, only the chart data would be fetched.

### Automatic Query Limit
If a select query doesn't have a LIMIT clause, Querybook will add a default one for it automatically. Querybook will also tell users if the number of rows returned has reached the limit. Users can turn it off by selecting the `none` option.
