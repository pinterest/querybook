## Text To SQL

Hover over to the left side of the query cell and click the star-like icon will open the text-to-sql modal.

### Query Generation

To use it: select the table(s) you are going to query against and type your question prompt and hit Enter.

If you're unsure which table to use, you can also type your question directly and AI will try to find the table(s) for you.

### Query Editing

If you would like to modify the generated query, you can keep the query and type in the prompt to edit it.

If the query cell already has a query, open the text-to-sql modal will automatically go to the edit mode.

## SQL Completion

SQL completion offers SQL code suggestions similar to GitHub Copilot while you write queries.
This feature is disabled by default. You can enable it in the Editor tab of user settings.

## Search Tables and Queries by Natural Language

If the [vector store](../integrations/add_ai_assistant.mdx#vector-store) of the AI assistant plugin is enabled, you'll be able to search both tables and queries using natural language in addition to traditional keyword-based search.
