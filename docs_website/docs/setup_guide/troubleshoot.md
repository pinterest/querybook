## An HTTP request took too long to complete.

This situation might happen when you run `make` in the terminal. To resolve it, run `make bundled_off` to turn off all containers, and run `COMPOSE_HTTP_TIMEOUT=240 make` to try again. If this happens too frequently, consider setting `COMPOSE_HTTP_TIMEOUT=240` as an environment variable.

## Elasticsearch connection error:

If datadocs are not showing up in search results and
if when you run `make` you get the following message in the bash console:

```sh
elasticsearch    | [2019-03-27T20:35:00,273][INFO ][o.e.x.m.p.NativeController] [kcqBkjB] Native controller process has stopped - no new native processes can be started
```

#### Linux/WSL

Simply run `sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144` in your machine, outside Docker, and run `make` again.
(We'll add an automatic check for this).

#### Mac

Go to Docker Desktop -> Top Right Gear (Preferences) -> Resources -> Advanced and set the memory limit to be higher than 5GB.
