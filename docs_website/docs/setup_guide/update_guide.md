Updates to Querybook will follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org). More specifically:

-   MAJOR version update includes:
    -   Changes in database data that requires a manual update
    -   Changes that would break the code of the plugin
-   MINOR version update includes:
    -   Major feature improvements
    -   Change in the database schema
-   PATCH version update includes:
    -   Bug fixes
    -   Code Refactor
    -   Small feature improvements

When updating, please check if there is a **major** version difference. If there is, check out the changelog to see what actions are required.
If there is a **minor** version difference, it is recommended to update the database to the latest version via alembic. You can run the following to do so:

```sh
docker run -it querybook:version_to_update_to bash
cd querybook
export DATABASE_CONN=mysql://....
PYTHONPATH=server alembic upgrade head
```
