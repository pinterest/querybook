There are two ways to setup Querybook:

1. [Single-Machine Instant Setup (locally or on server)](quick_setup.md)
2. [Multi-Machine Setup](prod_setup.md)

The single machine method is a quick way to tryout Querybook for <5 users usage and it uses docker-compose to bring up all the necessary infrastructure. Please check [Single Machine Setup](quick_setup.md) for details.

If you want to scale Querybook for thousands of users, then the multi-machine setup is required. The multi-machine setup runs Querybook containers on different machines/pods. It is more complicated to setup and requires external infrastructure. Get started by visiting [Production Setup](prod_setup.md).
