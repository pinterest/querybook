Depending on deployment of Querybook, manual re-initialization of indices in ElasticSearch might be needed when upgrading to new versions of Querybook.

This may happen for example when your `web` component is not started with `querybook/scripts/bundled_docker_run_web` script with `--initdb` option.

In such a cases, one has the following options how to initialize them manually:

1. In Docker based deployments, attach to `web` or `worker` component and run

    ```shell
    python ./querybook/server/scripts/init_es.py
    ```

2. Locally, set following keys to proper values in `querybook/config/querybook_config.yaml`
    ```shell
    FLASK_SECRET_KEY: ...
    DATABASE_CONN: ...
    REDIS_URL: ...
    ELASTICSEARCH_HOST: ...
    ```
    and run
    ```shell
    PYTHONPATH=querybook/server python ./querybook/server/scripts/init_es.py
    ```
