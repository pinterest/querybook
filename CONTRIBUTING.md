## Fixing Bugs

## Adding New Features

We welcome and appreciate anyone for adding new features for DataHub!
Following is the current process:
- Please create a GitHub issue proposing your new feature, including what and why. It can be brief, one or two paragraphs is ok.
- The project maintainers will then approve the new feature proposal.
- You can then briefly describe your intended technical design for the new feature.
- The project maintainers will then approve the technical design and/or request changes.
- Then you can implement the new feature as per "Making Changes" and send for code review!

## Making Changes

Please first check "Fixing Bugs" or "Adding New Features" as appropriate.

1. Create a new branch off of master. (We can't currently enable forking while the repo is in private beta)
2. Make your changes and verify that tests pass
3. Commit your work and push to origin your new branch
4. Submit a pull request to merge to master
5. Ensure your code passes both linter and unit tests
6. Participate in the code review process by responding to feedback

Once there is agreement that the code is in good shape, one of the project's
maintainers will merge your contribution.

To increase the chances that your pull request will be accepted:

-   Follow the coding style
-   Write tests for your changes
-   Write a good commit message
