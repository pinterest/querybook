To make changes to the SQLAlchemy database model definitions, you need to run the following migrations:

```
# Edit datahub/alembic.ini sqlalchemy.url to point to the database
# go into the docker terminal
cd datahub
PYTHONPATH=server alembic revision --autogenerate -m "<>commit message<>"
PYTHONPATH=server alembic upgrade head

# OPTIONAL: if you ran the script from remote server
# and need to sync it back from devapp to local
./datahub/scripts/sync_alembic_from_remote [Your remote repo location]
```
