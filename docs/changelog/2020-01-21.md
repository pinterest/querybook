# January 2020 (version 2.1.0)

Welcome to the first release of DataHub this year 🎉.

Following are the top new features we have added during these past two months:

-   **Advanced Datahub Charting**: Transform data and create charts right from the query results! Added new chart types and customizations.
-   **Collections**: Marie Kondo your workspace by grouping your DataDocs and favorite tables into lists!
-   **Improved Ad Hoc Querying**: Convert a past run into an ad hoc execution with one click! Also draft ad hoc queries are now persistent as you navigate.
-   **Viewer Badge**: Know your consumers! Each doc & table now has a badge to show the total number of views. Clicking it shows its top visitors and trends over time.

#### Creating a list

Create a list by going to the list tab and clicking on the “+” button. List's name is the only required field and does not need to be unique.

Once a list is created, you can add any data docs and tables. Clicking an already added doc/table will remove it from the list.
