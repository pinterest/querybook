# Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security issue in this project, please report it using
[Bugcrowd](https://bugcrowd.com/pinterest).

This will allow us to assess the risk and make a fix available before we
publish a public bug report.

Thanks for helping us make our software safe for everyone!
